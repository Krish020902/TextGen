The Path of the Forgotten Gate

A text-based interactive fiction game where you explore an ancient forest, solve puzzles, and unlock the legendary Gate of Eternity.

Story

You awaken on a broken stone path deep within a cursed forest. Strange runes whisper of forgotten magic, and legends tell of the Gate of Eternity that lies hidden at the far end of this path.

Armed with courage, wit, and the relics you uncover, your journey begins...

Why I Chose This Story

I went with this story because Iâ€™ve always liked adventure themes that feel a bit like Indiana Jones â€” exploring ruins, finding hidden relics, solving puzzles, and uncovering mysteries. Itâ€™s exciting, but also easy for anyone to imagine while playing a text-based game. The idea of a cursed forest and a legendary gate gave me the freedom to add puzzles and magical relics without making it too complicated.

Also, the image I used was made with Gemini, since I couldnâ€™t find one that really fit the mood on Pinterest.
