    "## The Text Adventures Library\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a framework designed for this class called _Text Adventures_, which is included in this repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level\n",
    "\n",
    "The main concepts we are concerned with when building a game with Text Adventures are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Things: _locations, items, and characters_\n",
    "* Actions: things a character can do\n",
    "* Blocks: things that prevent a character from going somewhere\n",
    "* Commands: how a user interacts with the game\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things\n",
    "\n",
    "_Things_ can have _properties_. A property is some detail about the thing that influences how other things can interact with it. A poisonous potion might have the property `is_poisonous` set, or a locked door might have `is_locked` set. Properties are designed to be flexible and easily extensible without significant code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Things_ can also have commands associated with them. A rosebush might have a command that lets characters pick a rose from the bush, and that rose might have a command for smelling it.\n",
    "\n",
    "All _things_ are stored in `text_adventures.things`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "An action is something a user does to change the game's state, such as changing location, eating food, or attacking something.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user enters a command, the game will parse the command to determine its intent and route it to the appropriate action. This means a user can type _go west_ and the game will work out that this means `text_adventures.actions.Go` and it will determine if the character can move west based on where the character is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game's state might change each time an action is executed, so action instances are created for each command and the game's state is re-evaluated to determine if the action will be successful or fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocks are useful for implementing things like a locked door or if some direction is guarded by a monster.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a user attempts to enter a location that is blocked from where they are, the command will fail with some information about why. It's up to the game designer as to whether or not a block can be removed."
